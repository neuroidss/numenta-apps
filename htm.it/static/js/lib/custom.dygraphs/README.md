DyGraphs 1.0.1

Custom Numenta version.

* MER-2948: Added 'x' axis option 'axisLabelOverflow' allowing labels to overflow.

* MER-2877: Added 'Y' axis option 'axisLabelOverflow' allowing labels to overflow

* SOON: Newest Dygraph for Retina/HiDPI, with Brev's fix for a <div> that's
  incorrectly 2x width, causing huge unnecessary horizontal scrollbar.

These fixes should be submitted back to Open Source, and when done,
get DyGraphs out of bower again.

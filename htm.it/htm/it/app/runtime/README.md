### metric_collector

The module `metric_collector` will collect metric data from all data sources
using the appropriate [data adapter](../adapters) at the metric scheduled
interval.  Once the model processes the newly streamed data the results are
pushed to the `htm.it.model.data` exchange and stored in the `metric_data`
database table.


### metric_streamer

The module `metric_streamer` will stream to the model associated with the
source metric.


### anomaly_service

The module `anomaly_service` runs anomaly likelihood calculations and
broadcasts final model results to downstream services, such as
`notification_service`


### notification_service

The module `notification_service` monitors anomaly scores in near real-time,
and sends notifications upon threshold triggers.

${0} is used by rpm-creator.py to prepare a git checkout of this repo for
packaging.

You almost certainly do not want to run this in your checkout; it deletes
all the .py files from the current directory (and all subdirectories), then
nukes the .git directory as well. This is likely to make you very sad if it
happens someplace you are doing work.

If you really, *really* want to run it, do:

${0} --destroy-all-my-work

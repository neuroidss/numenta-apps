# nupic.bindings 0.2.1 (required by nupic 0.3.4) is not installable w/ pip.
# Install explicitly w/ easy_install, which will install from .egg (as opposed
# to .whl).  Meanwhile, nupic.bindings specifies numpy>=1.9.2, resulting in a
# version (1.12.0) that is incompatible with nupic 0.3.4 so before that we'll
# install explicit numpy==1.9.2 w/ pip
pip install numpy==1.9.2

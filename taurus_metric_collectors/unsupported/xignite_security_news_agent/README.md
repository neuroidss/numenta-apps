Xignite Security News Agent collects news releases and headlines for securities
of interest via Xignite Global News API and converts them to news volume feeds
into the corresponding Taurus (HTM-for-Stocks) models.

These models were deprioritized and removed from the Taurus project and the
agent's source code was archived here for possible future re-use.

The agent was functional prior to
https://github.com/numenta/numenta-apps/pull/545 that removed it via commit
69a1007477031664a4858fb0c05162952392896b.

The agent's extracted code and configuration portions have been archived inside
xignite_security_news_agent.tar.gz to avoid loss in the event the repository is
pruned.
